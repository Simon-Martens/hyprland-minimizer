# Hyprland minimizer

This is a little tool that minimizes the currently focused window in Hyprland to the tray. It gets shown in the waybar tray. The icon title is the current window class or xdg-name-something, so you might just have to adjust your waybar config to show the appropriate icon. It uses the DBUS, but don't ask me, how.

Do with this thatever you want, I don't care, It's vibe coded. Honestly, I don't even know what the code actually does or how it works, and I don't want to, as long as it does what it does.
